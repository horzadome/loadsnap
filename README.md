loadsnap
========
A simple script to generate server load snapshot for later investigation

**Requirements but works without them too:**
-  sysstat
-  bwm-ng

Just run it, no arguments required (or possible), and by default reports are saved to
/var/log/loadsnap/$timestamp

**Tips:**

- `chmod 755 -where-you-placed-this-script-` and `ln -s -where-you-placed-this-script- /usr/bin/loadsnap`


**Licence: Beerware**

If you use it, feel free to buy me a beer when you see me. If you feel like it. If you don't, then don't :D'
